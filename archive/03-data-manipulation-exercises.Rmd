# Load Packages

Load the `tidyverse` package and the `ggplot2` package.

```{r}

```

# Import data: chds6162_data

Import the chds6162_data to a dataframe called `data`. 

```{r}

```



# select

![](slides/images/select.png)

Use `select` to show just the `marital` variable.

```{r}

```



`select` for multiple variables:

Use `select` to show `marital` and `ed` variables.

```{r}

```

Use  `select`  for a range of columns. 

`select` all the variables from `wt` to the end.


```{r}
# option one:



# option 2:


```

Drop the `race` variable.

```{r}

```

Drop the variables taht belonged to the father from `drace` to `dwt`


```{r}



```

# mutate

![](slides/images/mutate.png)

Create a **new variable with a specific value**

Create a new variable called `country` and make all responses to it "US".

```{r}

```


Create a **new variable based on other variables**

Create a new variable called `gestation_weeks` and calculate gestation lenght in weeks rather than days (try rounding this number to only 2 decimals). Remember that the `gestation` variable is a measure of the **gestation lenght** in days. Then `select`both variables. 

```{r}

```

Change an **existing variable**

Convert the `dwt` variable to kilos by dividing by 2.205 (it's in pounds now). Then, use `select` to show only the `dwt` variable.

```{r}

```


# filter

![](slides/images/filter.png)

We use `filter` to choose a subset of cases.

Use `filter` to keep only respondents who are divorced (`marital` = 3). 

```{r}

```

Use `filter` to keep only respondents who are **not** divorced. 

```{r}

```


Use `%in%` within the `filter` function to keep only those whose mothers' race was reported as white. In this dataset, values from 0 to 5 represent "white" under the `race`variable.

```{r}

```

Create a chain that keeps only those are college grads (value of 5). Then, `filter` to keep only those who are not married. Finally, use `select` to show only the `ed` and `marital` variables.

```{r}

```


# summarise

![](slides/images/summarize.png)


Get the mean, median, min, and max weight for the fathers `dwt`.

```{r}

```


# group_by

![](slides/images/group-by.png)

Calculate the mean weight for fathers based on their education levels (`ded`variable has some NAs, don't forget to drop them!)

```{r}

```


# Create a new data frame

A new data frame called `mothers_below30` that:

1. Uses `filter` to only include those age younger than 30
2. Uses `mutate` to transform the `gestation` variable into weeks rather than days
3. Uses `group_by` to create mom education groups
4. Uses `summarise` to calculate a new variable called `mean_gestation_w`

```{r}

```
